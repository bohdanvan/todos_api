Rather simple ToDo List built with HTML/CSS as well as JavaScript as a front-end technology package and NodeJS(Express) server in conjuction with MongoDB as back-end. User can add more tasks by writing the task and pressing "ENTER". User can also delete the task by pressing the red cross to the right of the item. User can also mark tasks as inactive by single-clicking on them. Inactive items are easy to spot since they are subject to respective visual changes. You can also click on an inactive task to make it active once again and vice versa. Refreshing the page does not reset the state since the list of the items is connected to the database.
